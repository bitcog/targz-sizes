This piece of code is so simple (currently 130 lines of C code total with
comments and other stuff), that anybody with some programming skills could write
it from scratch. However, releasing code without a license would technically
forbid anyone from looking at it at all, and this is not what I mean.

I, Tomasz Melcer, place targz_sizes under GPL v3 license. A copy of the text of
this license can be easily found on a dedicated web site [1]. However, I am not
a religious follower of the church of FSF, and if you have any nice arguments
why should I relicense it or give a less strict license to you, just contact me.
